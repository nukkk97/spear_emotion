You are given two speech clips, in the following order:

1. Audio A
2. Audio B

**Your task:**  
Ignore background noise and content â€” focus only on emotion conveyed by the speech. Decide which speech sounds more {emotion}? (a) Audio A (b) Audio B.

STRICT_OUTPUT = """
**Output format:**
Respond with either **(a)** or **(b)** only.
